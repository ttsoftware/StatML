\section{II.1.1}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Standard training set accuracy: 0.86
	\item Standard test set accuracy: 0.789473684211
\end{itemize}

We notice that the test accuracy is slightly better than the one found with K-NN in the previous assignment, which was approximately 0.76.

\section{II.1.2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Normalized training set accuracy: 0.6
	\item Normalized test set accuracy: 0.684210526316
\end{itemize}

We notice a worse result after normalization, which is not quite what we expected. We expected at least the same results, since we are normalizing with a linearly mapping.
However as shown in the figures below, the relative distance between the datapoints have changed.

This changes the covariance matrix, and since we assume identical covariance matrix for all class-conditionals, we get unpredictable results when normalizing for 0 mean and variance, before applying LDA.

\section{II.1.3}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{What is its (Bayes optimal) risk?}
\item \textit{What is the Bayes optimal classifier?}
\item \textit{What is the risk of the probabilistic classifier?}

We did look at the slides you referred, but we still couldn't make anything out of it. We have a hard time figuring out how to construct the classification and find the hypothesis function and would like an explanation of this on thursday.

\end{itemize}

\section{II.2.1}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Which of the 3 models provide the best prediction?} 
the RMS for the three selections on the test data are as mentioned:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{RMS Selection 1:} 29.9041602819
		\item \textbf{RMS Selection 2:} 28.6056297404
		\item \textbf{RMS Selection 3:} 17.9638970659
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ml_selection_1.png}
	\caption{Selection 1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ml_selection_2.png}
	\caption{Selection 2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ml_selection_3.png}
	\caption{Selection 3}
\end{figure}

We see from our figures that selection 3 gives the best fit on the test set, while also having the lowest RMS of 17.9638970659.

\section{II.2.2}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Which of the three models seem to provide
the best prediction?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Like with the ML solution, the 3rd selection using the highest number of years seems to fit the best. This is confirmed by the RMS values.
	\end{itemize}
\item \textit{How do the results compare with the maximum likelihood
results?}
	These are our RMS results for $\alpha = 0.5$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{RMS for map selection1:} 29.9112229729
		\item \textbf{RMS for map selection2:} 28.6058321345
		\item \textbf{RMS for map selection3:} 17.9664239687
	\end{itemize}
\item \textit{For what value of the prior precision parameter $\alpha$ does the RMS error go below the RMS for the maximum likelihood solution from Question II.2.1?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We could not find an $\alpha$ for which the RMS for MAP was lower than that found in our ML solution. As expected we came closer and closer to $RMS_{ML}$ when $\alpha$ approached 0, but as we increased $\alpha$, so did our $RMS_{MAP}$ and as such we could not improve on the results found with the ML solution.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{II.2.3}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Find an expression for the solution $\textbf{w}^*$ that minimizes this error function.}

To minimize the error function, we differentiate it, set it equal to 0, and then isolate w.

\begin{eqnarray}
	\frac{\delta E_D}{\delta w^T} &=& \frac{1}{2}\sum^N_{n=1}(2r_n(t_n - w^T \phi (x_n))(-\phi (x_n))\\
	0 &=& \frac{1}{2}\sum^N_{n=1}(2r_n(t_n - w^T \phi (x_n))(-\phi (x_n))\\
	0 &=& \frac{1}{2}\sum^N_{n=1}(2r_nt_n - 2r_nw^T \phi (x_n))(-\phi (x_n))\\
	0 &=& \frac{1}{2}\sum^N_{n=1}2r_nt_n\phi (x_n) + 2r_nw^T \phi (x_n)^2\\	
	0 &=& \sum^N_{n=1}r_nt_n\phi (x_n) + r_nw^T \phi (x_n)^2\\
	0 &=& \sum^N_{n=1}(r_nt_n\phi (x_n)) + \sum^N_{n=1}(r_nw^T \phi (x_n)^2)\\
	0 &=& \sum^N_{n=1}(r_nt_n\phi (x_n)) + w^T\sum^N_{n=1}(r_n \phi (x_n)^2)\\
	-\sum^N_{n=1}(r_nt_n\phi (x_n)) &=& w^T\sum^N_{n=1}(r_n \phi (x_n)^2)\\
	\frac{-\sum^N_{n=1}(r_nt_n\phi (x_n))}{\sum^N_{n=1}(r_n \phi (x_n)^2)} &=& w^T\\
	\left(\frac{-\sum^N_{n=1}(r_nt_n\phi (x_n))}{\sum^N_{n=1}(r_n \phi (x_n)^2)}\right)^T &=& w\\
\end{eqnarray}


\item \textit{Give two alternative interpretations of the weighted sum-of-squares
error function in terms of}
\begin{itemize}
\item[i)] \textit{data dependent noise variance}

\begin{eqnarray}
	E_D(w) &=& \frac{1}{2}\sum^N_{n=1} r_n(t_n - w^Ty(x_n, w))^2
\end{eqnarray}

\item[ii)] \textit{replicated data points}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We have no idea what replicated data points describe.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
